            "content_html": "<p>Initially, my pathfinding algorithm led to performance loss when multiple enemies on a vast map attempted to calculate paths simultaneously, sometimes every frame. To enhance this, I devised a solution where, regardless of their current state, enemies could persist in their activities while awaiting the completion of path calculations. This transition ensured that upon receiving their calculated paths, they could effortlessly shift to the next state, utilizing the paths without hindering much of performance. That solution was thread pool, by making use of modern CPU, which usually come with multi-cores and threads.</p>\n<p>I encountered a subsequent challenge where certain tasks needed to be executed as swiftly as possible, which current thread pool class could not meet the requirement. To address this, I designed a separate priority queue for such tasks, assigning them a priority range from 0 to 1, with higher numbers indicating higher priority. This ensured that tasks in the priority queue were executed before those in the normal queue.</p>\n<p>After a code review, my classmates and I engaged in a discussion concerning the potential issue of certain tasks never begin executed if higher priority tasks were continuously added. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"What if some tasks remain unexecuted due to the constant influx of higher priority tasks?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The solution I had in mind was some sort of timer for every tasks in queue. Since this 'potential issue' had not yet occurred, I decided it wasn't necessary to allocate time to address it immediately. Instead, I documented it, along with other potential issues and improvements, for future consideration.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><a href=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/threadpool2.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/threadpool2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1390\" height=\"518\" sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-xs.png 384w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-sm.png 600w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-md.png 768w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-lg.png 1200w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-xl.png 1600w\"></figure></a></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><a href=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/threadpool3.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/threadpool3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1471\" height=\"566\" sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool3-xs.png 384w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool3-sm.png 600w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool3-md.png 768w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool3-lg.png 1200w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool3-xl.png 1600w\"></figure></a></p>\n<p> </p>",

The theme was \"Isolation\", but if you've tried the game, you'll notice ours is quite the opposite. The hamsters are isolated, yet they are not! We had a really fun experience playing Hamster 16 with other TGA students. Initially, players started off by attacking each other and harbouring wicked thoughts, but they soon begin to cooperated, trying to beat the game! One team managed to clear the game after more than half an hour and witnessed the ending cinematics! The ironic quote of the day was, \"One more game!\".</p>\n<p>Due to some unknown issues the WebGL version could not display some visual effects and ending cinematic properly. Unfortunately, since the time was short, we did not had extra time to allocate to investigate and fix this issues. If you're interested you can try to download the game and play with your friends or colleagues!</p>\n<p><em>Recommended of 2 - 4 players using hand controllers and loud stereo speakers! You can play Hamster 16 on the website or download the game here at</em> <a href=\"https://carrydev.itch.io/hamster16\">https://carrydev.itch.io/hamster16</a> </p>",
