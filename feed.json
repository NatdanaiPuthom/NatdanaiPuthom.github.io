            "content_html": "<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"textLeft\">\n<p>Initially, my pathfinding algorithm led to performance loss when multiple enemies on a vast map attempted to calculate paths simultaneously, sometimes every frame. To enhance this, I devised a solution where, regardless of their current state, enemies could persist in their activities while awaiting the completion of path calculations. This transition ensured that upon receiving their calculated paths, they could effortlessly shift to the next state, utilizing the paths without hindering much of performance. That solution was thread pool, by making use of modern CPU, which usually come with multi-cores and threads. I encountered a subsequent challenge where certain tasks needed to be executed as swiftly as possible, which current thread pool class could not meet the requirement. To address this, I designed a separate priority queue for such tasks, assigning them a priority range from 0.0 to 1.0, with higher numbers indicating higher priority. This ensured that tasks in the priority queue were executed before those in the normal queue. After a code review, my classmates and I engaged in a discussion concerning the potential issue of certain tasks never begin executed if higher priority tasks were continuously added.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"image\"><a href=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/threadpool2.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><figure class=\"post_image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/threadpool2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1597\" height=\"652\" sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-xs.png 384w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-sm.png 600w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-md.png 768w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-lg.png 1200w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-xl.png 1600w\"></figure></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"textLeft\">\n<pre>\"What if some tasks remain unexecuted due to the constant influx of higher priority tasks?\"</pre>\n<p>The solution I had in mind was some sort of timer for every tasks in queue.

At that time, my understanding of a 'game jam' was limited to the basic concept of game creation. Eager to participate, I joined forces with fellow students to form a team called Tiny Green Ants and we registered for the Climax Game Jam. This was my first game jam experience and it turned out to be incredibly enjoyable! It was so engaging that I found myself on the brink of addiction, barely sleeping throughout those 48 hours. Despite the exhilaration, I've decided that in future game jams, I will make sure to get proper rest. I am proud to have secured 3rd place in this friendly game jam, a remarkable achievement and learning experiences.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h5> </h5>\n<h5 class=\"testContainer\"> <img

class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"textLeft\">\n<h5><strong>Character movements</strong></h5>\n<p>I aimed for the character to rotate along the y-axis withing a 0 to 180-degree range, based on the mouse's position on the x-axis. Due to the time constraints preventing further investigation into the spin-walking issue, I opted to calculate the distance between the mouse position and the character, introducing a minimum threshold for how close the mouse can be to the character. If the distance falls below this threshold, the character won't rotate. The downside of this method is that it causes the character to snap quickly in certain mouse positions. However, this was deemed bearable compared to the constant spin-walking players would experience, as revealed through a quick playtest by my teammates.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"image\"><figure class=\"post_image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/11/vlc_0qgOip2WCj.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1597\" height=\"652\"></figure></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"image\"><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/11/vlc_iKacL3qsjY.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1073\" height=\"629\"></figure></div>\n<div class=\"textRight\">\n<h5><strong>Dialogue System</strong></h5>\n<p>Among other features, I implemented were the 3D sprite pop-up utilizing 3D planes with applied textures that include transparency.

Witnessing its dynamic animations propelled me into a deep dive into the realm of procedural animation, where I delved into the intricacies of concepts like inverse kinematics (IK). Eager to implement this in my project, I first had to tackle the basics: loading models and animations into the engine. Despite my initial lack of knowledge, I successfully integrated models, skeletons, and animations using FBXSDK. However, the animations didn't play correctly. After days of searching for the culprit, I discovered the issue was in the shader I had mistakenly used the '+' operator instead of '*'.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ImageContainerWithText\">\n<div class=\"image-container dynamic-size\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/7/SimpleEngine-Debug_8kfNkMub3u-1712868063513.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\"></div>\n<div class=\"text-container\">hehe</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ImageContainerWithText\">\n<div class=\"image-container dynamic-size offset-right\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/7/SimpleEngine_Debug_A6hPT9Xp8N.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\"></div>\n<div class=\"text-container\">finally!</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"textLeft\">\n<h5><strong>Animation Blend</strong></h5>\n<p>Utilizing a model previously created in <a href=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/spelprojekt-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Abalabos</a>,I incorporated linear interpolation to smooth transitions between different animations for testing purposes. <em>You can read more about my IK journey here, <a href=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/inverse-kinematic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Inverse Kinematic</a>.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ImageContainerWithText\">\n<div class=\"image-container dynamic-size\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/7/SimpleEngine-Debug_8kfNkMub3u-1712868063513.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\"></div>\n<div class=\"text-container\">test</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ImageContainerWithText\">\n<div class=\"image-container dynamic-size offset-right\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/7/SimpleEngine_Debug_ocAc1gAiZ8.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\"></div>\n<div class=\"text-container\">LERP</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"textLeft\">\n<h5><strong>Profilering (EasyProfiler)</strong></h5>\n<p>While implementing and testing animations, I encountered significant performance hit when updating multiple instances of the same animation type.
