            "content_html": "<p><strong>(this article is inprogress of writing)</strong></p>\n<p><br>Initially, my pathfinding algorithm led to performance loss when multiple enemies on a vast map attempted to calculate paths simultaneously, sometimes every frame. To enhance this, I devised a solution where, regardless of their current state, enemies could persist in their activities while awaiting the completion of path calculations. This transition ensured that upon receiving their calculated paths, they could effortlessly shift to the next state, utilizing the paths without hindering much of performance. That solution was thread pool, by making use of modern CPU, which usually come with multi-cores and threads.</p>\n<p>I encountered a subsequent challenge where certain tasks needed to be executed as swiftly as possible, which current thread pool class could not meet the requirement. To address this, I designed a separate priority queue for such tasks, assigning them a priority range from 0.0 to 1.0, with higher numbers indicating higher priority. This ensured that tasks in the priority queue were executed before those in the normal queue.</p>\n<p>After a code review, my classmates and I engaged in a discussion concerning the potential issue of certain tasks never begin executed if higher priority tasks were continuously added. </p>\n<pre>\"What if some tasks remain unexecuted due to the constant influx of higher priority tasks?\"</pre>\n<p>The solution I had in mind was some sort of timer for every tasks in queue. Since this 'potential issue' had not yet occurred, I decided it wasn't necessary to allocate time to address it immediately. Instead, I documented it, along with other potential issues and improvements, for future consideration.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"> <a href=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/threadpool2.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/threadpool2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1390\" height=\"518\" sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-xs.png 384w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-sm.png 600w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-md.png 768w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-lg.png 1200w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-xl.png 1600w\"></figure></a></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><a href=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/threadpool3.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/threadpool3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1471\" height=\"566\" sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool3-xs.png 384w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool3-sm.png 600w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool3-md.png 768w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool3-lg.png 1200w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool3-xl.png 1600w\"></figure></a></p>",

At that time, my understanding of a 'game jam' was limited to the basic concept of game creation. Eager to participate, I joined forces with fellow students to form a team called Tiny Green Ants and we registered for the Climax Game Jam. This was my first game jam experience and it turned out to be incredibly enjoyable! It was so engaging that I found myself on the brink of addiction, barely sleeping throughout those 48 hours. Despite the exhilaration, I've decided that in future game jams, I will make sure to get proper rest. I am proud to have secured 3rd place in this friendly game jam, a remarkable achievement considering our unfair advantages of having 10 members, in contrast to the smaller sizes of other teams!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h5> </h5>\n<h5 class=\"testContainer\"> <img src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/11/tiny.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"86\" height=\"64\" sizes=\"(min-width:

class=\"textCenterScrollView\">\n<p>During this game jam, I set up a Discord server, Perforce mainline, the Unity project, along with creating tutorial videos to help my teammates set up their workspaces. Beyond these preparatory tasks, my primary focus was on developing character movements and controls, including the flashlight below.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"textLeft\">\n<h5><strong>Character movements</strong></h5>\n<p>I aimed for the character to rotate along the y-axis withing a 0 to 180-degree range, based on the mouse's position on the x-axis. Due to the time constraints preventing further investigation into the spin-walking issue, I opted to calculate the distance between the mouse position and the character, introducing a minimum threshold for how close the mouse can be to the character. If the distance falls below this threshold, the character won't rotate. The downside of this method is that it causes the character to snap quickly in certain mouse positions. However, this was deemed bearable compared to the constant spin-walking players would experience, as revealed through a quick playtest by my teammates.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"image\"><figure class=\"post_image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/11/vlc_0qgOip2WCj.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1597\" height=\"652\"></figure></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"image\"><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/11/vlc_iKacL3qsjY.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1073\" height=\"629\"></figure></div>\n<div class=\"textRight\">\n<h5><strong>Dialogue System</strong></h5>\n<p>Among other features, I implemented were the 3D sprite pop-up utilizing 3D planes with applied textures that include transparency.
