            "content_html": "<p>Initially, my pathfinding algorithm led to performance loss when multiple enemies on a vast map attempted to calculate paths simultaneously, sometimes every frame. To enhance this, I devised a solution where, regardless of their current state, enemies could persist in their activities while awaiting the completion of path calculations. This transition ensured that upon receiving their calculated paths, they could effortlessly shift to the next state, utilizing the paths without hindering much of performance. That solution was thread pool, by making use of modern CPU, which usually come with multi-cores and threads.</p>\n<p>I encountered a subsequent challenge where certain tasks needed to be executed as swiftly as possible, which current thread pool class could not meet the requirement. To address this, I designed a separate priority queue for such tasks, assigning them a priority range from 0 to 1, with higher numbers indicating higher priority. This ensured that tasks in the priority queue were executed before those in the normal queue.</p>\n<p>After a code review, my classmates and I engaged in a discussion concerning the potential issue of certain tasks never begin executed if higher priority tasks were continuously added. </p>\n<pre>\"What if some tasks remain unexecuted due to the constant influx of higher priority tasks?\"</pre>\n<p>The solution I had in mind was some sort of timer for every tasks in queue. Since this 'potential issue' had not yet occurred, I decided it wasn't necessary to allocate time to address it immediately. Instead, I documented it, along with other potential issues and improvements, for future consideration.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"> <a href=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/threadpool2.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/threadpool2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1390\" height=\"518\" sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-xs.png 384w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-sm.png 600w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-md.png 768w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-lg.png 1200w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool2-xl.png 1600w\"></figure></a></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><a href=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/threadpool3.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/threadpool3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1471\" height=\"566\" sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool3-xs.png 384w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool3-sm.png 600w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool3-md.png 768w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool3-lg.png 1200w ,https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/13/responsive/threadpool3-xl.png 1600w\"></figure></a></p>",

At that time, my understanding of a 'game jam' was limited to the basic concept of game creation.

This was my first game jam experience and it turned out to be incredibly enjoyable! It was so engaging that I found myself on the brink of addiction, barely sleeping throughout those 48 hours. Despite the exhilaration, I've decided that in future game jams, I will make sure to get proper rest. I am proud to have secured 3rd place in this friendly game jam, a remarkable achievement considering our unfair advantages of having 10 members, in contrast to the smaller sizes of other teams!</p>\n<p>During this game jam, I set up a Discord server, Perforce mainline, the Unity project, along with creating tutorial videos to help my teammates set up their workspaces. Beyond these preparatory tasks, my primary focus was on developing character movements and controls, including the lamp below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Character movements</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/11/vlc_0qgOip2WCj.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1597\" height=\"652\"></figure>\n<p>I aimed for the character to rotate along the y-axis withing a 0 to 180-degree range, based on the mouse's position on the x-axis. Due to the time constraints preventing further investigation into the spin-walking issue, I opted to calculate the distance between the mouse position and the character, introducing a minimum threshold for how close the mouse can be to the character. If the distance falls below this threshold, the character won't rotate. The downside of this method is that it causes the character to snap quickly in certain mouse positions. However, this was deemed bearable compared to the constant spin-walking players would experience, as revealed through a quick playtest by my teammates.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Dialogue System</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://natdanaiputhom.github.io/media/posts/11/vlc_iKacL3qsjY.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1073\" height=\"629\"></figure>\n<p>Among other features, I implemented were the 3D sprite pop-up utilizing 3D planes with applied textures that include transparency. Additionally, I incorporated dialogue text system which also triggers voice lines recorded by our game artist.</p>\n<p><em>You can play Kurt's Night Shift here at <a href=\"https://despacitos.itch.io/kurts-night-shift\">https://despacitos.itch.io/kurts-night-shift</a> </em></p>",

We had a really fun experience playing Hamster 16 with other TGA students. Initially, players started off by attacking each other and harbouring wicked thoughts, but they soon begin to cooperated, trying to beat the game! One team managed to clear the game after more than half an hour and witnessed the ending cinematics! The ironic quote of the day was, \"One last game!\".</p>\n<p>Due to some unknown issues the WebGL version could not display some visual effects and ending cinematic properly.

If the player fails to choose the correct direction or presses the button at the wrong time, they are 'predicted' to veer off the path, resulting in a loss. However, if the direction is correct but the button is pressed slightly too early, the player will instead glide along an 'invisible wall' while running.

Upon investigation, I could see that instantiating the candies was taking a significant amount of time. Since the candies were already loaded the first time the player entered the level, there was no need to destroy and re-instantiate them each time the same level was reloading. Instead, I just made the candies inactive and hid them, then reactivated them! I also plays the visual effects and sound our artist made and updating the score count.</p>",
